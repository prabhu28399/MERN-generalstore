        Disney Channel Disney+ Phineas and Ferb is an American animated
        musical-comedy television series created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff
        "Swampy" Marsh for Disney Channel and Disney XD. The series originally
        aired on the networks for four seasons between 2007 and 2015 and is
        scheduled to return for two additional seasons beginning in 2025. The
        series follows stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during
        summer vacation. Every day, the boys construct a grand project or embark
        on a spectacular adventure to make the most of their time on vacation.
        This annoys their controlling older sister, Candace, who frequently
        tries to expose their schemes to her and Phineas's mother. The series
        follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode.
        Povenmire and Marsh conceived the characters while working together on
        animated programs The Simpsons and Rocko's Modern Life in the 1990s, and
        were inspired by the summers of their own childhoods. They developed the
        series together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before
        successfully selling it to The Walt Disney Company. Phineas and Ferb is
        produced by Disney Television Animation, and was originally broadcast as
        a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007, following the premiere of the
        made-for-television film High School Musical 2. It again previewed on
        September 28, 2007, and officially premiered on Disney Channel on
        February 1, 2008. The series originally concluded on June 12, 2015,
        before two new seasons were ordered in January 2023, with the first
        season scheduled to premiere on Disney Channel and the streaming service
        Disney+ in summer 2025. Phineas and Ferb is one of Disney Channel's most
        successful animated franchises. It received high viewership in the
        United States on cable television and influenced the development of
        merchandise, a live tour, spin-offs, and movies. A made-for-television
        film, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, aired in
        2011, while a follow-up titled Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace
        Against the Universe was released on Disney+ in 2020. Critics praised
        the writing and humor of the show, citing its appeal to a wide range of
        ages. Others criticized its lack of originality and formulaic approach.
        The series won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2010 for Outstanding Writing in
        Animation and several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual
        Achievement in Animation. Premise The series follows the adventures of
        stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher.[3][4] They live in the
        fictional city of Danville in an unspecified tri-state area, as they
        seek ways to occupy their time during their "104 days of summer
        vacation". Often these adventures involve elaborate, life-sized, and
        ostensibly dangerous construction projects, which are usually
        unrealistic in scale given the protagonists' ages (and sometimes
        physically impossible). Phineas's older sister Candace has two
        obsessions: unveiling Phineas and Ferb's schemes and ideas, and winning
        the attention of a boy named Jeremy.[5] The subplot almost always
        features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry, who works as a secret
        agent for an all-animal government organization named O.W.C.A.
        ("Organization Without a Cool Acronym").[6][7] His usual objective is to
        defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist
        driven largely by a need to assert his evilness, whose own ineptitude
        often defeats him.[8] The two plots intersect at the end of each
        episode, erasing all traces of the boys' project just before a dismayed
        Candace can show it to their mother and destroying Doofenshmirtz's evil
        contraption; either occurrence usually indirectly leads to the other's
        in some way. Episodes Main article: List of Phineas and Ferb episodes
        Most of the episodes premiered in pairs of two 11-minute stories, while
        others were released on their own. Disney Television Animation produced
        the episodes in two variants: they were primarily paired in 22-minute
        shows but also produced as individual episodes. Thus, a credits scene
        was made for each quarter-hour episode, while for the packaged variant,
        only the credits from the second "segment" would be used. Nowadays, the
        series is aired in the 22-minute format, with the separate variants
        being occasionally shown as fillers. Digital and streaming releases,
        like on iTunes and Disney+, have the episodes in pairs. Season Segments

        2015 Characters Main article: List of Phineas and Ferb characters A
        platypus was included in the series because of its interesting
        appearance.[9] The series' main characters live in a blended family, a
        premise that the creators considered underused in children's programming
        and that reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining
        the family background "not important to the kids' lives. They are a
        great blended family and that's all we need to know."[10] The choice of
        a platypus as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, as
        well as the animal's striking appearance.[9] Povenmire and Marsh wanted
        an uncommon species, an animal that kids could not "pick out at a pet
        store and beg [their parents] for."[11] The platypus also gave them
        freedom to "make stuff up" since "no one knows very much about
        them",[10] and allowed them to own that "mental real estate", so that if
        someone thinks of the word "platypus", they will associate it with Agent
        P, just as an ogre is now commonly associated with Shrek.[12] Marsh
        called the characters "cool, edgy and clever without ... being
        mean-spirited." Animation director Rob Hughes is said to have noted that
        "in all the other shows every character is either stupid or a jerk, but
        there are no stupid characters or jerks in this one."[5] Development
        Early inspirations Povenmire drew inspiration for the show from his
        boyhood in Mobile, Alabama.[13] Dan Povenmire attributes the show's
        genesis to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama, where his mother told him
        to never waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook
        projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled,
        "My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our
        living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of
        spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8
        camera."[3][13][14] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very
        detailed drawings at art shows.[15] Marsh was raised in a large, blended
        family.[16] As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and
        taking part in various activities to have fun.[5] Conception Drawn on
        butcher paper, this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of
        characters and the outline of the artistic style.[5] While attending the
        University of Southern California, Povenmire started a daily comic strip
        called Life Is a Fish, and received money from the sale of its related
        merchandise. He eventually dropped out and started drawing people on
        street corners to make a living, until he was finally called by Tommy
        Chong to work on a short bit of animation in the film Far Out Man.
        Povenmire began to take up animation professionally, working on shows
        such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[15] Marsh had become a vice
        president of sales and marketing for a computer company until he
        "freaked out" and decided to quit. His friend helped him put together a
        portfolio and enter the animation business.[16] Povenmire and Marsh
        started working across from each other as layout artists on The
        Simpsons. The two bonded over mutual tastes in humor and music, becoming
        fast friends. They continued their working relationship as a writing
        team on the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life,[3] where they
        conceived the idea for their own series.[3] While eating dinner at a
        Wild Thyme restaurant in South Pasadena, Povenmire drew a quick sketch
        of a "triangle kid" on butcher paper.[17] He tore it out and called
        Marsh that night to report, "Hey, I think we have our show."[9] The
        triangle doodle sparked rapid development of characters and designs.[17]
        Povenmire decided that his sketch "looked like a Phineas," and named
        Ferb after a friend who "owns more tools than anyone in the world."[18]
        The creators based their character designs on angular shapes in homage
        to Tex Avery, an animator and director for MGM and Warner Bros., adding
        geometric shapes to the backgrounds for continuity.[17] Pitching and
        pickup Disney Channel was the first network to give the series a chance,
        though initially declined when Dan Povenmire originally pitched it to
        them. The writing duo's early attempts to pitch the show failed and,
        though they remained committed to the concept, Povenmire and Marsh began
        to drift apart after their work on Rocko's. Marsh moved to London and
        worked on shows including Postman Pat and Bounty Hamster. Povenmire
        began working on the primetime Fox series Family Guy[3] and the
        Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants, always carrying a Phineas and
        Ferb portfolio[9] for convenient pitching to networks such as Cartoon
        Network and Fox Kids. The networks passed on the show, believing the
        series' premise was too complex to succeed.[3] Povenmire persisted and
        again pitched the series to Nickelodeon, where it was considered by
        high-level executives but rejected once more as overly complicated.[3]
        Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney.
        The network did not immediately accept the show but told Povenmire that
        it would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed that this had meant an end
        to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually "means they throw it in
        the trash later." Disney then surprised him by accepting.[15] Said
        Povenmire, "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see if you can do it in
        11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can
        do it for 26 episodes.'"[5] Povenmire was initially worried that his
        work on Family Guy (an adult show known for its lowbrow humor) would
        concern Disney, which markets its fare primarily to families. However,
        Disney Channel senior vice president of original series Adam Bonnett was
        a Family Guy fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and
        received his pitch well.[5] In 2006, after the Disney Channel had
        accepted the show, Povenmire and Marsh turned their attention to the
        company's overseas executives. Instead of penning a normal script, the
        two drew out storyboards and played them in a reel. Povenmire voiced
        over the reel with his dialogue and added sound effects. This novel
        approach secured the executives' support.[13] Production Writing style
        Phineas and Ferb co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh in
        2009 The show uses four main writers to devise story ideas according to
        "strict guidelines", such as that the boys' schemes never appear to be
        "magical". Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday, then
        simultaneously scripted and storyboarded. A very rough design is built
        before the storyboard, featuring little more than suggested scenes and
        dialogue, is drafted; the writers then gather for a "play-by-play"
        walkthrough of the storyboard in front of
